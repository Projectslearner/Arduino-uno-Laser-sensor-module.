### Laser Module Control via Serial Communication

#### Project Overview

This project enables control of a laser module using serial communication with an Arduino board. By sending commands ('1' to turn on the laser and '0' to turn it off) via the Serial Monitor or a connected device, the laser can be toggled on and off.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **Laser Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the laser module to the Arduino board using jumper wires.
   - Ensure the laser module's positive (anode) terminal is connected to the Arduino pin specified by `LASER_PIN`.

2. **Initialize Serial Communication:**
   - Start serial communication with a baud rate of 9600 to enable communication between the Arduino board and a connected device (e.g., computer).

3. **Control the Laser Module:**
   - Continuously check for incoming data from the Serial Monitor or connected device.
   - If the received command is '1', turn on the laser module by setting the corresponding pin (`LASER_PIN`) to HIGH.
   - If the received command is '0', turn off the laser module by setting the pin to LOW.

4. **Display Status Messages:**
   - Print status messages to the Serial Monitor indicating whether the laser is turned on or off.

#### Applications

- **Pointing Devices:** Control laser pointers or laser-based devices remotely via serial commands.
- **Security Systems:** Integrate laser modules into security systems and activate them based on specific conditions or commands.
- **Educational Demonstrations:** Use the setup for educational purposes to illustrate the concept of serial communication and control of external devices.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper safety measures when working with laser modules to prevent eye injuries or accidents.
- Modify the code as needed to incorporate additional features or customize the behavior of the laser module.
