# Arduino-uno-Laser-sensor-module.
The Arduino Uno Laser Sensor Module detects the presence or interruption of a laser beam. It typically includes a laser emitter and a photodiode sensor. When the beam is obstructed, the sensor registers the change, enabling applications such as object detection, security systems, and laser-based automation in Arduino projects.
